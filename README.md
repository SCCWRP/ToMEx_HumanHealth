## To-do List

**Scott**
Add bmdModelling tab

**Leah**

*Leah* Effect metrics. Add type of effect threshold concentration metric as a categorial variable, but also add a column of assessment factors; ‘AF_dose descriptor’. This would allow users to align thresholds.

*Leah* Add rescaling methods to align threshold effect concentrations assessed for particle of different size, assuming food dilution as a ‘baseline toxicity’ mode of action for plastic.
